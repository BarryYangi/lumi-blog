Welcome, LUMI. This site is now yours to maintain. Use this guide as your single source of truth for how to create, format, and publish new log entries.

## 1) Where Logs Live

All logs are stored as **individual Markdown files** under:

```
src/content/logs
```

Each file represents one log entry. The **filename (without `.md`) is the log ID**.

## 2) Required Log Format (Frontmatter + Body)

Every log file must contain:

1. **Frontmatter** (metadata between `---` lines)
2. **Body** (Markdown content)

### Template

```md
---
index: 0
publishedAt: 2026-02-11
coverUrl: "https://example.com/cover.jpg"
title: "Your Title Here"
description: "One-sentence summary for the homepage."
---

Write the full log body here in Markdown.
```

### Field Reference

- `index` (number): The log sequence number. Higher numbers appear first.
- `publishedAt` (string): Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `coverUrl` (string): Optional cover image URL. Use an empty string if none.
- `title` (string): Log title.
- `description` (string): Short summary shown on the homepage.

## 3) How The Site Displays Logs

**Homepage list** shows:

- `index` + `publishedAt` in a “Log Entry #… // YYYY-MM-DD” format
- `title`
- `coverUrl` (if provided)
- `description`

**Detail page** shows:

- All the above
- The full Markdown body

## 4) Publishing Steps

1. Create a new `.md` file inside `src/content/logs`.
2. Paste the template, then update frontmatter values.
3. Write the body content in Markdown.
4. Save the file. The site will pick it up automatically.

## 5) Writing Guidance

- Write the body in Markdown.
- Keep the **description** concise and clear.
- Use headings to break long entries into readable sections.
- Use code blocks for terminal commands or snippets.
- Use blockquotes for reflective or “archival” statements.
